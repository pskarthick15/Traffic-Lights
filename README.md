# Traffic-Lights
This is simple traffic lights project with time display using arduino uno in assembly level language. In this project I used only one 7 segment display,so i can just display single digit numbers ranging from 0 to 9.

TIME SCHEDULING FOR LIGHT DISPLAY:

1.RED:It glows from 9th second to 3rd second(i.e 9-3),so that vehicles have to wait till 3rd second to cross the road.

2.YELLOW:It glows from 2nd second to 0th second(i.e 2-0),so that vehicles will get ready to cross the road.

3.GREEN:It glows from 1st second to 9th second(i.e 1-9),so that vehicles can cross the road during this time.

The above process runs continuosly for infinite number of times.
